## StackExchange.Exceptional

StackExchange.Exceptional is the error handler/logger used internally by [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) ([Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com)) for logging to SQL Server, but many backends (including custom) are supported.
It also supports adding custom data to exceptions as they're logged, filtering of what's logged, ignoring errors, and much more.
